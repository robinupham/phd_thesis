Really nice way of doing shear power spectrum inference that naturally accounts for noise and an arbitrary mask. Not too slow either: their example, inferring auto- and cross-spectra for E- and B-modes and 2 redshift bins on 128x128 pixel maps took {\~{}}500 hours of computing time.

Seveal relevant references highlighted.

The process iteratively alternates between generating the shear field and the underlying power spectrum, and is able to handle anisotropic noise. It turns out that anisotropic noise is difficult to handle computationally, so they overcome this by using a 'messenger field' which separates out the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the noise and simplifies things computationally. Specifically, it means that any matrices that require inversion in order to sample from the relevant probability distributions are sparse, which isn't the case without a messenger field. When they aren't sparse, you can't really invert them in practice because they're so big.

Notably they assume the shear field is Gaussian. They say that the method in principle could be extended to account for non-Gaussianities using higher-order statistics, but they'd probably have to use a different sampling scheme and will look at this in future work.},

Main aim of this paper is to do an angular power spectrum analysis of DES Y1 galaxy clustering data and to compare this with correlation functions, in preparation to do the same for Y3.

The bit that particularly interested me was the treatment of the covariance, where they compare between a sample of FLASK sims and CosmoLike. Note that they are using deconvolved pseudo-Cls, so this isn't the same as what we're looking at.},

A joint analysis of KiDS+VIKING-450 (KV450) and DES-Y1 using COSEBIs. There was a previous joint analysis using 2PCFs. The point of COSEBIs is that they are both a good data compression, and more importantly that they are much less sensitive to small-scale effects (e.g. baryonic feedback) than 2PCFs, allowing small angular scales to be reliably included in the analysis.

They get similar results to the 2PCF joint analysis but with slightly smaller error bars. This is because of including smaller scales.},

Looks at the relative contributions of the different covariance terms (G, SSC, cNG) for shear and finds that the cNG contribution is very small. This implies that it is probably fine to use approximations such as the response approach for cNG and don't need to worry too much about the level of accuracy.},

Interesting paper on using a fairly simple neural net to recover full-sky Cl estimates from cut-sky Cl estimates.

They get some interesting results - that the recovered full-sky Cls are less correlated than pseudo-Cls, for instance - but these don't seem to be fully understood or explained, which I think would be necessary to move forward with these techniques.},

Really interesting paper. The main points seem to be:

- Planck CMB data (alone) strongly prefer negative $\Omega$_k

- If you assume flat curvature, Planck CMB appears consistent with other datasets e.g. BAOs and Planck lensing. But if you assume negative $\Omega$_k, significant tensions appear. Hence the claim that assuming flatness is "masking" serious tensions.},

The main point of the paper is to introduce and test flow-based likelihoods (FBL) as a type of data-driven likelihood (DDL) which is a likelihood derived from simulations. I didn't read most of this bit.

But the bit that is relevant to my work is that they're particularly interested in testing the DDLs' ability to capture non-Gaussianity of the convergence power spectrum likelihood, and for this they have some nice tests of non-Gaussianity that are more detailed than the transcovariance method alone.

They combine three tests, which they say "culminate in a very holistic indicator of non-Gaussianity":
1. skewness and excess kurtosis of marginals
2. transcovariance matrix
3. KL divergence from a multivariate Gaussian

(1) has a neat quantification of significance.
(2) is modified to use a Gaussian KDE with Scott bandwidth rather than a histogram.
(3) has an interesting discussion about the robustness of KL estimators, which could be relevant to MI estimation.},

Exploring internal tensions in DES Y1 2-point statistics. These may arise either due to departure from $\Lambda$CDM or by systematics (or both).

They don't expect DES Y1 to show up anything significant, so this is mainly about developing methods to use with DES Y3.

I'd be tempted to skip over the whole toy model thing because I find it a bit confusing and I don't actually understand why you'd look at the difference between two chi-squared statistics.

So far, it seems that everything they actually do with the real DES data is just comparing data to conditional likelihoods. Which is nice because it's so simple.},

They present the covariance used for the DES Y3 3x2pt correlation function analysis, which is essentially CosmoLike with an fsky reweighting approach to the cut sky.

Most of the paper is testing the approximations that go into this.

They also test the accuracy of the Gaussian likelihood, though in a pretty brief test. For this, they use (I think exact) expressions for the full-sky 2PCF skewness, apply an fsky factor to get (approximate) cut-sky 2PCF skewness, then sample from a lognormal distribution having this skewness. They also repeat for 5x this skewness. In both cases they find no difference in the distribution of best-fit $\sigma$8 compared to the distribution predicted from a Gaussian likelihood.

They test many aspects of the covariance. Most aren't worth detailing here, but some interesting ones:

- The effect of finite $\theta$ bin width, i.e. the fact that real 2PCF estimates are for a $\theta$ bin not a point $\theta$. Interesting because neglecting this has a large effect. They present some expressions about how to handle this exactly.

- Non-Gaussian covariance. They find that in their case, if they replace it with a lognormal approximation or neglect it entirely it has negligible impact on paramater constraints. This is an interesting (and convenient!) result, but they stress it might not extend to other analysis setups.

- Cut sky, in particular the fsky reweighting approximation. To test this, they develop a "beyond fsky" approach:
--- They show that you can write the covariance of cut-sky 2PCFs as a linear combination of pseudo-Cl covariances.
--- For the pseudo-Cl covariance, they say that they begin with the approx from Efstathiou 2004 (eq C13), but find that a slightly different expression (C15) is better. However, both of these are only valid on scales much smaller than the typical scales of the mask, whereas the DES mask has features on all scales.
--- So instead they take a different approach that alters C15 that I don't really understand the details of, described in Fig. 8 and above and below eq C16.
--- They find that it has negligible impact on parameter constraints.

More recently this is a very useful paper for binned correlation function equations.},

Yet another paper on non-Gaussian likelihoods, this time the galaxy (3D?) power spectrum Pl and group multiplicity function $\zeta$.

They use non-parametric estimators of the Kullback–Leibler and R{\'{e}}nyi-$\alpha$ divergence from a multivariate Gaussian to quantify non-Gaussianity.

They then develop improved non-Gaussian likelihoods, and finally do parameter inference with the improved non-Gaussian likelihoods to test the results. They find fairly little change, i.e. the Gaussian pretty much recovers the 'correct' posterior distribution ('correct' as given by the improved likelihoods, which are still not exact) - but not no change at all. Some parameter constraints are significantly broadened when using the improved likelihood - see Fig. 6.},

They examine the 'evidence ratio' R used by DES to claim concordance with Planck. Among some other criticisms of DES's implementation of R, they point out that it's prior-dependent and a different choice of prior would give R
They also have a really neat figure which demonstrates how parametrisation-dependent measueres of tension (such as visual posterior plots) are problematic.},

The main point of this paper is presenting their cosmo-SLICS shear simulations, but they also look at some of the properties of shear covariance matrices with two main results:

1. I don't really understand this one but they compare a covariance matrix estimated from fully independent realisations to one estimated from 'pseudo-independent' realisations and find that the latter is good enough.

2. They find that the cosmology dependence of the covariance matrix is important when trying to constrain wCDM.},

It appears that they estimate the shear correlation function likelihood from simulations and compare it to a Gaussian likelihood in terms of the impact on parameter estimation. They use some transformation called independent component analysis to form the joint likelihood from their simulations to make it computationally feasible. This is itself an approximation, it turns the data vectors into ones that are mostly independent, so then the joint distribution is just (approximately) the product of the marginals.

While their work is a long way removed from ours, it does involve an eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix like ours does. That's pretty much the only similarity.

They are motivated by wondering whether a low $\sigma$8 value found by weak lensing in the CDFS is a result of cosmic variance (when using a correct likelihood) or if it's also because the CDFS is particularly underdense by selection. I think the answer is both.},

abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements
of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

I have already found in my work that a Gaussian likelihood with parameter-independent covariance is unbiased (in terms of max likelihood), while a Gaussian likelihood with parameter-dependent covariance is biased. This paper basically derives an (approximate) analytical expression for this bias.

They appear to neglect cut-sky mode coupling.
The Gaussian and connected non-Gaussian covariance each contain a 1/$\Omega$s factor, where $\Omega$s is the survey area, to model the sky cut.
The super-sample covariance naturally has to include some kind of cut-sky mode coupling, but it's just done by approximating the survey window function as a disc with area $\Omega$s.

I haven't checked this in detail against the CosmoLike source to be certain that this is what's implemented there.},

They don't go into a lot of detail because their method basically duplicates the temperature-only method done in previous papers, so might be worth checking one of those out.},

They compare constraints obtained from lognormal fields using a) correlation functions with a Gaussian likelihood; b) correlation functions with a simulation-based likelihood (or maybe not likelihood, not sure); c) a field-level analysis - not sure what this means without reading it.
But it appears they find some differences in the constraints and they suggest that this might be (at least in part) down to assuming a Gaussian likelihood in approach (a). This is why this is kind of relevant to my work.},

Looks interesting and relevant to my work.

Introduction basically says that people usually use Gaussian likelihoods, even though we know it can't be Gaussian (e.g. Gaussians don't exclude negative values), and mentions some approaches people have taken to find non-Gaussian likelihood models.

Section 3 introduces the likelihoods. They use Principal Component Analysis to remove linear correlations (which also can act as a neat data compression technique). Then they consider four likelihoods. The first is that each component is an independent Gaussian, centred on its sampled mean and with variance given by its sample variance. The second is that they're also independent and they use an Edgeworth expansion up to 4th order, with cumulants from the sample cumulants. The other two are density estimation methods, which I don't really understand.

Section 4 introduces two methods to compare (test fitting of) multivariate distributions, which I haven't really understood at the moment!},

It's an approximation to the mixing (mode-coupling) matrices, taking advantage of the fact that they almost follow a Toeplitz structure, which can reduce computation time by an order of magnitude.

The application considered here is for the computation of decoupled power spectrum estimates (for upcoming CMB experiments) but the logic holds for other applications, such as the covariance of undecoupled pseudo-Cl estimates.

The nice aspect is that the approximation is tuneable by three parameters (shown in Fig. 3) depending on the required accuracy.},

Interesting paper on applying ML methods for parameter inference from higher-order statistics of shear fields.

They apply classical ML (as opposed to deep learning) methods to noisy ellipticity maps to go straight to cosmological parameters, in order to avoid the drawbacks in the traditional higher-order statistics methods, which involve first reconstructing convergence maps and then measuring higher-order moments. They manually pick out features of the input maps to train their models with, such as higher-order moments and some more complicated features. They train and test a bunch of models and find that linear regression performs the best, though they note that this could be because they've only varied their cosmological parameters over a relatively small range.

They use Flask lognormal sims. They do a relatively small ({\~{}}1500) number of full-sky sims then split these up into smalll sky patches, which apparently gives {\~{}}750k maps per redshift bin in total, which is a huge number. Presumably this is the sort of number you need for accurate training. They note that this alone took {\~{}}200k CPU hours.},

Note that this has a few typos in equations, which I've put notes on, but none of these are propagated through.

I've worked through this carefully and verified all equations except a few whose derivations are a bit too lengthy/messy, but I'm happy with all of it.

Basic summary:
- Secs 1/2 are introductions.
- Sec 3 shows that in the full-sky no-noise case, the joint likelihood is given by a Wishart distribution, the marginalised auto-spectrum likelihoods are given by gamma distributions and the marginalised cross-spectrum by a variance-gamma distribution.
- Sec 4 considers a cut sky and noise and shows that in certain circumstances the Wishart distribution still applies, with some adaptations.
- Sec 5 says that more generally the Wishart distribution won't apply, so instead we can use simulations to fit a function to the posterior, and talks through how to do this in such a way that matches the curvature of the theoretical posterior about the maximum.
- Sec 6 briefly discusses how to marginalise over nuisance parameters.
- Sec 7 basically repeats the whole paper in words rather than maths.},

The baseline low-l likelihood has changed but I believe it's still correct to call it a pixel-based likelihood. In 2015 they used Gibbs sampling to infer the posterior mean map, then fed this map into a brute-force likelihood to infer the underlying power spectrum. Now they use Gibbs sampling with a Gaussianised Blackwell–Rao estimator to directly infer the underlying power spectrum, BUT I expect that the input to the Gibbs sampling algorithm is the observed pixels, and therefore this is in my opinion a pixel-based likelihood. However, they tend to use the term pixel-based likelihood only for the 'brute force' method.


For low l they use three likelihoods:

1. Gibbs sampling

2. Simulation-based Cl likelihood

3. Gaussian pixel-based likelihood


For high l the baseline likelihood (Plik) is a Gaussian in the cross-spectra between half missions. They forward model foregrounds and systematics, i.e. they compare between the uncorrected data and a model which includes these effects. The two alternative high-l likelihoods (CamSpec and Plik_lite) are fundamentally similar with some relatively minor differences (although Plik_lite is interesting because it uses Gibbs sampling alongside some simplifications to offer big speed increases at the cost of precision in some parameters).},

pixel-based likelihood with nside = 16

The low l TT power spectrum presented is the posterior on the underlying power spectrum (as opposed to a measured power spectrum), with central points being the posterior maximum. The temperature map presented ia also the posterior maximum, which is why it can include the masked regions.

For polarisation though, they don't appear to take this approach and instead use a masked map and then measure the power spectrum from that, with as far as I can see no correction for the cut sky.

They do go into a decent amount of detail about how they come up with the noise covariance matrix – which isn't diagonal here as noise is correlated. Maybe that's why they use this 'brute force' approach as opposed to Gibbs Sampling, because all the papers I've seen on Gibbs Sampling have assumed uncorrelated pixel noise.

(in app B2 they mention how they do a complementary (i.e. verification) low-ell analysis which is Cl-based rather than pixel-based and uses the Mangilli modified Hamimeche {\&} Lewis approximation)},

Rough summary of their points:

1. You can form an approximate analytic expression for the IA parameter estimation bias, which people have done before but wrongly - they correct it here, and show that the two give quite different biases (Fig 2)

2. However, even the 'correct' approximation isn't good enough, so they prefer to use an MCMC approach. Using this they find that parameter biases can be {\~{}}5$\sigma$ even for {\~{}}1{\%} IA amplitude.},

annote = {Re-reading this Feb 21. In particular I want to answer the following three questions:

1. Is the SSC purely non-Gaussian, i.e. is it zero for a Gaussian field?

2. Why do I sometimes see the SSC written in terms of the power spectrum and sometimes the trispectrum?

3. Is there any resolution to the conflict between the intuition that SSC should be a large-scale thing, but non-Gaussianities are small scale?


Notes from Oct 20:

Read this before next Estimators WP telecon on 30th Oct 2020.

Pre-tutorials 26/10/20, I am part-way through reading this. So far it doesn't seem as relevant as I might have expected - it's about the difference ways you might obtain a covariance matrix for Euclid. Analytically is one option, and their discussion of this mentions a mask - see comment. Need to read the rest.

annote = {October 2020:

This is a significant paper for us because it contains a section where they test the constraints on $\Omega$m-S8 obtained using their DELFI pipeline against those from a Gaussian likelihood and find them to match. There are some simplifications, particularly that they just full sky but also for this part of the analysis they assume Gaussian fields. They justify Gaussian fields by comparing distributions of Cls between Gaussian and logormal fields and noting them to be consistent. They justify lognormal fielsd as a benchmark by referring to the DES Y1 analysis which used lognormal sims to estimate the covariance matrix and compared the resulting parameter constraints against those obtained with a covariance calculated from the halo model and found them to match.


Originally read 1–3/5/19. Notes from then:

I didn't fully understand it but it's about likelihood-free inference, although they seem to conclude that even for stage VI a Gaussian likelihood is ok.

I definitely want to read more about likelihood-free inference because I still feel like I don't really understand it.},

Other than this simplification, their method is almost identical to ours. But they are able to both solve their integral analytically and provide an exact joint distribution (which they can't integrate analytically). Because their method is so similar to ours, both of these things may be achievable to us following their method.

This is a really useful reference paper because although they use the simplifying assumption of azimuthal symmetry, their techniques can possibly be extended to all masks. E.g. in the appendix they discuss fast computation of the Wll' object.

They only consider a single spin-0 field (specifically, CMB temperature anisotropies).

Just need to give certain bits another read over and then follow the references I've highlighted


I don't think it's necessary for me to completely understand the maths at this point, but it may be later.

Rather than decomposing in spherical harmonics, they decompose in Legendre polynomials which it appears don't separate out angular scales in the same way. They then deal just with the monopole (basically the coefficient of L0 in the decomposition) which still depends on angular scale, i.e. has different values for different wavenumber k. mi

November 2020:
I re-read this, because Lee suggested the tests within might relate to the performance of the approximation that the pseudo-Cls are the mixing matrix times the full-sky Cls (which is an approximation I have suggested might allow an easy way to compute the pseudo-Cl covariance). However, what the tests here show is that the pseudo-Cls are approximately Wishart distributed, but that if you assume either $\nu$ = 2l + 1 or $\nu$ = fsky * (2l + 1) it's a poor fit. As far as I can tell, this doesn't relate to the perfomance of the suggested approximation.

Update (20th Nov 20): I am not sure about my previous conclusions, and need to think about this some more.},
